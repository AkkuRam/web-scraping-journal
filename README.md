# Web-scraping-journal

- Currently, this uses selenium to web-scrape some basic category information from a journal. This requires a login using your username and password to access the page.
- This would have to be changed, by using a VPN, but I did not have access to one, so this was not possible.
- Moreover, clicking would have to be fixed, there is an inconsistency about navigating to the next page.
